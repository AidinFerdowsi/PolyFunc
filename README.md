# PolyFunc Framework

## Introduction
This project aims to create a server development framework that dynamically chooses the most efficient programming language for each microservice based on the functionality described by the user. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret descriptions and generate code.

## Goals
- To implement a framework that decomposes descriptions into microservices.
- To utilize the best programming language for each microservice based on performance and suitability.
- To create a flexible and scalable system that supports multiple programming languages.
